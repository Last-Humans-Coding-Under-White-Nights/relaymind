## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Specification 0.1 → 0.2: section 6 now allows an operator option to
  enable Qwen3 thinking mode through the same chat-template settings.
  Non-thinking stays the default and the latency-experiment
  configuration; reasoning output never appears as answer content, and
  results from the two modes are never mixed.

### Added

- Project scaffold: repository layout, CI, and contributor guides.
- Specification v0.1 (`docs/SPECIFICATION.md`) as the single source of
  truth for the prototype.
- Architecture and roadmap documents mapping spec components to code
  layout and milestones.
